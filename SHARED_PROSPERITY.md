# 📄 Shared Prosperity Policy

**Autogeneration Note:** This document was initially generated with an LLM. Revisions will occur, but sentiment should remain clear.
**Effective Date:** Pre-incorporation (2025)  
**Applies To:** All founders, employees, executives, and long-term contributors

---

## 🧭 Purpose

We believe a business should create enough value for everyone involved — not limitless wealth for a few. This policy exists to ensure that **no individual extracts more than what is necessary for lifelong financial security**, and that **ongoing value is shared fairly among all contributors**.

This is our commitment to **shared prosperity**, **compensation fairness**, and **long-term trust**.

---

## 💵 Total Compensation Cap

No individual at this company — **including founders, executives, employees, contractors, or advisors** — may receive more than:

> **$5,000,000 (USD) in total *after-tax* compensation, adjusted for inflation from 2025**

### ✅ What Counts Toward the Cap

- Salaries
- Bonuses
- Stock options or RSU proceeds (post-tax)
- Equity sales or liquidation events
- Any other financial benefits received from the company or its subsidiaries

Once this cap is reached, the individual's **ongoing salary or compensation** is **permanently limited** to the **median full-time employee compensation**.

---

## 📈 Inflation Adjustment

To maintain fairness across time, the $5M cap will be **adjusted annually** using the **Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)** as published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

### Example

If the CPI indicates 20% cumulative inflation between 2025 and 2030, then the cap in 2030 would be:  
`$5,000,000 × 1.20 = $6,000,000 (after-tax)`  

---

## 🔐 Scope & Agreement

This policy applies to:

- All **founders**, beginning before incorporation
- All **employees**, beginning upon offer acceptance or equity vesting
- All **contractors** or **executives** receiving equity or performance compensation

Acceptance of this policy is a **condition of joining** the company and is included in all offer letters, equity agreements, and governance documents.

---

## 🚫 No Workarounds

To maintain integrity, we prohibit all forms of circumvention:

- No deferred compensation beyond the cap
- No personal consulting deals with subsidiaries
- No non-transparent perks or family-based payouts
- No post-cap equity grants or indirect financial instruments

All compensation will be tracked transparently and reviewed by a neutral third-party as part of our annual **Compensation Accountability Report**.

---

## 🌱 Why This Matters

We believe:

- A **comfortable retirement** is a reasonable aspiration.
- **Excess personal wealth** is not a measure of value.
- Collective success is more powerful — and more sustainable — than personal extraction.

This policy creates alignment, fairness, and trust from day one.

---

## 🤝 Exceptions

While we expect this cap to hold in all normal cases, the company reserves the right to review requests for limited exceptions in the case of:

- Major medical hardship
- Disability or dependent care
- Relocation due to global conflict or environmental emergency

Any exceptions must be approved by a vote of an **independent governance committee** and published publicly (without disclosing personal information).

---

## 📜 Legal Integration

This Shared Prosperity Policy will be:

- Included in our **corporate bylaws**
- Referenced in our **governance charter**
- Incorporated into **all compensation and equity agreements**
- Subject to review and audit under company policy

---

## 🏁 Final Note

This policy is not a limitation. It is a **liberation** — from the myth that more is always better, from internal competition, and from the toxic norms of extractive capitalism.

Let’s build something fairer, together.
