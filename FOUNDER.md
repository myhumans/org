# Founder’s Compensation Manifesto

## 🌱 Why This Exists

This company was founded with a simple goal: to make meaningful human connection easier, more honest, and less extractive — both in how we serve people and how we operate as a business.

I believe the way we compensate leadership should reflect the world we want to build: one where *value is shared, not hoarded*.

## 💵 My Commitment: A Capped Return, Then Equality

As the founder and initial CEO of this company, I make the following public pledge:

### 1. Total Compensation Cap (Inflation-Adjusted)

Once I have received **$5 million USD (in 2025 dollars)** in total personal compensation *after taxes* — including salary, bonuses, stock, or other benefits — I will cap my salary at the **median compensation of all full-time employees**.

- The $5 million figure will be **adjusted annually for inflation** using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ **Consumer Price Index (CPI-U)** or a comparable inflation index.
- For example, if I reach the cap in *2030*, it will be measured against the inflation-adjusted equivalent of $5M in *2025* dollars.

### 2. No Hidden Payouts or Side Doors

- I will not authorize or accept equity deals, deferred bonuses, consulting arrangements, or other compensation vehicles that circumvent this cap.  
- Any profits from stock sales beyond the inflation-adjusted $5M threshold will be **reinvested into the company**, donated to mission-aligned causes, or distributed to employees.

### 3. Transparency & Accountability

- I will publish an **annual compensation report**, reviewed by a third party, detailing my total compensation to date and how it compares to the adjusted cap.
- Anyone — employee, user, investor — is welcome to hold me accountable.

## 🤝 What I Ask in Return

I ask those who join this mission — employees, collaborators, investors — to meet this energy. Let’s build a company that grows responsibly, treats people with dignity, and puts real connection before infinite growth.

## 🔐 Legal Note

This manifesto will be included in the company’s internal bylaws and/or founding documentation. Where legally enforceable, it will be embedded in our governance structure. If we ever reincorporate or restructure, this pledge must be preserved or made stronger — never weaker.
